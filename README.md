# Github Directory
By Raghda Al-Ajely

# Description
Ever tried to search for a user through Github? To access their profile information, followers, following and repositories take at least **6 clicks (!)** before you reach the section that you are most interested in. 

This Github user-finder helps you find any github user by entering a username to fetch a user's profile, information, repos and their network. _All visible one click away!_

Access it at the github repository [here](https://github.com/raaghda/githubdirectory) or through this link here.

# Resources
The app is built on the [Github API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/), which provides easy accessible and a wide database of all information connected to the github user.

# Built with
- Bootstrap

# Process
After having felt the frustration in using Github to search for users, the app idea came naturally as I started working with APIs. The Github API contains a lot of useful information and is a great way to learn to work with APIs. The goal with this app is to provide the user with the most important/interesting information that it may look for when searching for a github user. 

The time span for this project was fairly short. I chose to focus mainly on the JavaScript and to make quite a few api calls. As for future improvements, I am planning on improving on the HTML and CSS for a better UX as well as enhance the visual experience for the user. Overall the app is perfectly fit for purpose and is very useful.
